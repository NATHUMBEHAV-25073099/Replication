# Replication Package: [NATHUMBEHAV-25073099]

This repository contains all materials required to replicate the analysis in our manuscript:  
**AI-assisted Programming May Decrease the Productivity of Experienced Developers by Increasing Maintenance Burden**  
Authored by: Blinded for Peer Review 

All data were collected from GitHub.com using the GitHub GraphQL APIs. The replication analysis is conducted entirely in **Stata**.

## 3. Reproduction Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Do Files  
The do files comprise all the code to reproduce the results. Open the do file in stat and 'run' it. The folder contains multiple do files to reproduce specific tables from the manuscript.

### Step 2: Run Analysis  
- Open `xxx.do` files in Stata. We have numbered them so that you can replicate the results as teh tables appear i nthe manuscript.   
- Running the script will:
  - Load and prepare the data  
  - Perform the main Difference-in-Differences analyses  
  - Generate all tables and figures reported in the manuscript

> **Expected output**: All tables and figures is dispalyed in the manuscript
> **Expected runtime**: ~5â€“10 minutes on a standard desktop
