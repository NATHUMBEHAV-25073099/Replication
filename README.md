# Replication Package: [NATHUMBEHAV-25073099]

This repository contains all materials required to replicate the analysis in our manuscript:  
**AI-assisted Programming May Decrease the Productivity of Experienced Developers by Increasing Maintenance Burden**  
**Authors**: Blinded for Peer Review

All data were collected from GitHub.com using the GitHub GraphQL APIs. The replication analysis is conducted entirely in **Stata**.

## Contents

- `/Replication Code and Data/`: Stata `.do` files to reproduce the results, and `.xlsx` datasets  
- `/graphs/`: Output graphs and plots  
- `README.md`: This file

## 1. System Requirements

- **Software**:  
  - Stata 17 or later (tested on Stata/SE 17.0)  
  - Required user-written Stata packages (install via `ssc install`):  
    - `coefplot`  
    - `ftools`  
    - `reghdfe`  

- **Hardware**:  
  - Standard desktop or laptop with at least 8GB RAM  
  - No non-standard hardware required

## 2. Installation Guide

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Ensure that the `.do` files and the dataset files are in the same directory.  
3. Open the `.do` files using Stata 17 or later.  

> **Estimated setup time**: ~5 minutes on a standard desktop computer.

## 3. Reproduction Instructions

### Step 1: Open the `.do` Files  
The folder contains multiple `.do` files, each corresponding to a specific table or result in the manuscript. Open any of these files in Stata to reproduce the associated analysis.

### Step 2: Run the Analysis  
- The `.do` files are numbered to match the order in which results appear in the manuscript.  
- Running each script will:  
  - Load and prepare the relevant data  
  - Run the appropriate model (Difference-in-Differences and supporting analyses)  
  - Output tables and/or figures

> **Expected output**: Replication of tables and figures presented in the manuscript  
> **Expected runtime**: ~5â€“10 minutes on a standard desktop

## Notes

- All Stata output appears in the Results window or is saved to the `/graphs/` folder if graphical.  
- We recommend running the scripts in sequence for a complete replication.
